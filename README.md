# Simple Python Blackjack Game

This is a basic text-based Blackjack game implemented in Python. It allows you to play the popular casino card game Blackjack against a computer dealer.

## Rules

- The goal of the game is to beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 without going over 21.
- The value of a hand is determined by the sum of the values of the individual cards.
- Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points each.
- An Ace can be worth 1 or 11 points, whichever is more advantageous for the player.
- The game starts with two cards dealt to both the player and the dealer.
- The player can choose to "hit" (draw another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).
- The player can continue to "hit" or "stand" until they decide to stand or their hand value exceeds 21.
- The dealer must hit until their hand value reaches 17 or higher.
- If the player's hand value is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand, the player wins. If the player goes over 21, they lose.
